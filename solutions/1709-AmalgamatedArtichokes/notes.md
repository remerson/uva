## Categories

   * Math

## Approach

Not super happy here. My solution is AC but close to TLE. I think I am missing
a better (analytical) solution that avoids needing to calculate every k somehow
or can otherwise filter down the calculation space.

## Hints

   * Linear

## Optimisations

   * None attempted.
